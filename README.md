# Markdown test

### I am currently testing H3

Say I wanted to write something normal, but then put emphasis on the **banality** of the content I am writing, I think I would tend to use *italics* instead of bold.

### Making lists of shit also seams easy enough

*I just write the item
*A second Item
	*And then nest
	*Another list

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
	1. How will this do this
	1. ok

### This is a block quote

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

### This makes inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

### or we can just write block flavored code

##### Mhmmm, tastes like js

''' javascript
	function promiseMeThisWorks(prayer) {
		if(prayer.valid()) {
			return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
				setTimeout(()=> {
					console.log("prayer is answered");
					resolve();
				},
				1000000000000000000000000000000)
			})
		}
	}
}
'''

### task lists

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
